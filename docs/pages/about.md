This site is meant to facilitate the ongoing documentation of the **Multi-Sensor Mesh Network for Agricultural Analysis** Senior Design project. The Documentation team's goal is to pass on the means for the Design team to easily add and update content to reflect the progress of the project. Currently the site is hosted using GitHub Pages, a free site hosting service provided by GitHub.

To update this documentation site you have a couple options. Either contact the site admin through Github using a pull request with your specific changes, or *simply fork the repository on your Github account* and act as the site administrator yourself.

![Fork GitHub](https://github.com/BenKasson1/DocumentationAg2/blob/master/docs/assets/images/GHFork.png?raw=true")

In the **upper right** of any GitHub project is the button showed in the **image above**. By clicking Fork you have sent yourself an editable version of the repository. 

It should be noted that if you choose to take over site administration by forking or cloning this repository the URL adress will change.
Additionally the image call locations (in the MD files) will need to be changed to the new administrators ID, from the old BenKasson1 ID.
